# Getting Started With ArduPilot

## Connect Latest AsteRX OEM Receivers With Pixhawh 4 Using Robotics Interface Board

The steps below detail how to integrate a Pixhawk 4 with the latest generation AsteRx GNSS and INS
receivers using a Robotics Interface Board (RIB). In this example, the setup is done in a lab
environment using an AsteRx-m3 D receiver with RIB, without installing it on an actual UAS (Unmanned
Aerial System). Please note that the procedure is same for AsteRx-i3 S and AsteRx-m3 receivers (with
RIB kits).

The following materials are required for the integration:
* Windows Laptop/PC
* AsteRx GNSS OEM receiver
* Pixhawk 4
* Latest Mission Planner version installed on any Laptop/PC
* Dual-frequency GNSS antenna(s)
* Adapters and cables to interface with MMCX connectors
* 2 * Micro-USB cable

The integration encompasses the following steps:

### Step 1:

Make sure the receiver is powered with at least 3.3V. You can use the micro USB connector or the
open ended supply (labeled "PWR & GND").

### Step 2:

Connect one or two GNSS antennas to the external antenna ports on the AsteRx Receiver board as shown
in Figure 1.

### Step 3:

Now connect the AsteRx Receiver to the GPS MODULE port on the Pixhawk 4 as shown in Figure 2 and
figure 3 depending on your receiver.

</p>


### Step 4:

On a Windows Laptop/PC, download and install Mission Planner from the Ardupilot Website. The drivers
for the Pixhawk 4 will be installed, along with the Mission Planner software.

### Step 5: 

#### Download the Firmware

From the [releases](https://github.com/septentrio-gnss/Septentrio-ArduPilot-Autopilot/releases) in
this repository, download the assets corresponding to your setup (usually a .apj file). (To build
the code for a specific target board, download the Source code and follow the
[instructions](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-the-code.html) in the ArduPilot
documentation).

#### Connect Autopilot to Computer

Once you have installed a ground station on your computer, connect the autopilot using the micro USB
cable.

#### Select the COM Port

If using Mission Planner as the GCS, select the COM port drop-down in the upper-right corner of the
window near the Connect button. Select AUTO or the specific port for your board. Set the Baud rate
to 115200 as shown. Do not hit Connect just yet.

<p align="center">
  <img src="asterx_oem_rib_setup/step3.jpeg">
</p>


#### Install Firmware

In Mission Planner’s SETUP | Install Firmware screen click "Load custom firmware" and select the
.apj file.

Mission Planner will try to detect which board you are using. It may ask you to unplug the board,
press OK, and plug it back in to detect the board type.

If all goes well, you will see a status appear on the bottom right including the words: “erase…”,
“program…”, “verify..”, and “Upload Done”. The firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board.

It usually takes a few seconds for the bootloader to exit and enter the main code after programming
or a power-up. Wait to press CONNECT until this occurs.


### Step 6:
In Mission Planner, select the port corresponding to the Pixhawk 4 as shown in Figure 3 and then
click connect (please note that port enumeration will be different for different connections). Make
sure the baudrate matches the one of the receiver which is 115200 baud per default.

</p>

### Step 7:
After successfully connecting to the Pixhawk 4, select the "CONFIG" tab from the top and open the
Full Parameter List (highlighted on the left in figure 4). Now search for "GPS_TYPE2" and set its
value to 10 to select SBF as incoming data format, it will select the AsteRx receiver as the second
GPS as shown in Figure 4.
<p align="center">
<img width="75%" src="asterx_oem_rib_setup/step4.jpeg">
</p>
Also make sure that the "SERIAL4_BAUD" parameter is set to 115 and that "SERIAL4_PROTOCOL" is
configured as value 5 for GPS as shown in Figure 5.
<p align="center">
<img width="75%" src="asterx_oem_rib_setup/step5.jpeg">
</p>

Finally, you can also switch off the Ardupilot automatic configuration by setting "GPS_AUTO_CONFIG"
to 0 as shown below.

#### Dual Antenna Extra Parameters

For dual antenna setup, modify the following settings :
* [AHRS_EKF_TYPE](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ahrs-ekf-type) = 3 (to use EKF3)
* [EK2_ENABLE](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek2-enable) = 0 (to disable EKF2)
* [EK3_ENABLE](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek3-enable) = 1 (to enable EKF3)
* [EK3_MAG_CAL](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek3-mag-cal) is not used for this feature so it can be left at its default value (“0” for Plane, “3” for Copter, “2” for Rover)
* [EK3_SRC1_YAW](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek3-src1-yaw) = 2 (“GPS”) or 3 (“GPS with Compass Fallback”) if a compass(es) is also in the system
* [GPS_TYPE](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#gps-type) = 26 (SBF-Heading)


After applying all the above settings click on "Write Params" (on the right hand side of the screen
in above figures) to save the settings to memory.

### Step 8:

Now, open the receiver's webUI (or another interface) and define an SBF data stream on COM2 with an
output rate of 10Hz for AsteRx-m3. In the webUI, you can do this via NMEA/SBF Out as shown in figure
7. 

#### Single Antenna

For single antenna, the recommended SBF messages are "PVTGeodetic", "DOP", "VelCovGeodetic" and
"ReceiverStatus".
<p align="center">
<img width="60%" src="asterx_oem_rib_setup/step7.jpeg">
</p>


#### Dual Antenna

The recommended SBF messages for dual antenna are "PVTGeodetic", "VelCovGeodetic", "DOP",
"AttEuler", "AttCovEuler" and "ReceiverStatus".
<p align="center">
<img width="60%" src="software_setup/sbf_setup_dual.png">
</p>


After this, you can save the current configuration in the non-volatile memory of the receiver to
make sure that the receiver does not lose its configuration after power cycling. It can be done by
going Admin > Configurations and copying the "current" config to "boot" as shown below.
<p align="center">
<img width="60%" src="asterx_oem_rib_setup/step8.jpeg">
</p>


### Step 9:

Now the Pixhawk 4 should be able to receive SBF data through serial COM2 port of the receiver. On
the Flight Data screen, the GPS2 status should now be displayed, along with a location indicator on
the map. In this case, the screen reports 3D Fix for GPS2 to indicate a standalone solution as shown
in Figure 9.

### Step 10 (Only for Dual Antenna Setup)

The attitude (heading/pitch) can be computed from the orientation of the baseline between the main
and the aux1 GNSS antennas.
<p align="center">
<img src="hardware_setup/multi_antenna_attitude_setup.png">
</p>

To enable multi-antenna attitude determination, follow the following procedure:

1. Attach two antennas to your vehicle, using cables of approximately the same length. The default
   antenna configuration is as depicted in the figure. It consists in placing the antennas aligned
   with the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, main antenna behind aux1. For best accuracy, try to
   maximize the distance between the antennas, and avoid significant height difference between the
   antenna ARPs.
2. In practice, the two antenna ARPs may not be exactly at the same height in the vehicle frame, or
   the main-aux1 baseline may not be exactly parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
   the vehicle. This leads to offsets in the computed attitude angles. These offsets can be
   compensated for with the **setAttitudeOffset** command.

_For optimal heading results, the two antennas should be seperated by at least 30cm / 11.8 in
(ideally 50cm / 19.7in or more)_
